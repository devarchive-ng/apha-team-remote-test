Once upon a time, in the heart of the African savannah, there lived a mighty lion named Simba. Simba was the king of the jungle and all the animals in the jungle respected him for his strength, courage, and wisdom.

One day, a small mouse accidentally wandered into Simba's den. The lion was about to eat the mouse when the mouse pleaded with him to let him go, promising that he would someday repay the favor.

Simba laughed at the mouse, thinking that a tiny creature like him could never be of any use to the king of the jungle. However, he decided to spare the mouse's life and let him go.

Years passed, and one day, while Simba was hunting, he accidentally fell into a trap set by some hunters. He was captured and tied up, unable to move.

Simba knew that his life was in grave danger, and he started to roar loudly, hoping that someone would hear him and come to his rescue.

As fate would have it, the small mouse who he had once spared heard Simba's roars and immediately rushed to his aid. The mouse started to gnaw away at the ropes that held Simba captive, and after a few minutes, the ropes fell away.

Simba was free, and he looked at the mouse with newfound respect and admiration. He realized that even the smallest and weakest creatures could be of great help when it mattered the most.

From that day on, Simba became friends with the mouse, and they remained loyal to each other until the end of their days. The other animals in the jungle learned a valuable lesson from this incident, and they too realized that one should never underestimate the power of kindness and the strength of unity.
